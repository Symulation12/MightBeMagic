3 different single file act plugins that I use for handling trigger sets that require a bit more thinking.

LiterallyMagic.cs - My personal plugin that includes some of my general purpose triggers
FigurativelyMagic.cs - The plugin that contains only the specialized triggers that require a special plugin
LiterallyMagicAlso.cs - In-progress proof of concept for a plugin that would allow for easy creation of more advanced creation using sandboxed LUA


Uh maybe I'll figure out what to do with this
